<hr class='section' />

1. Ask the Lord through journaling if there are any issues that you are not approaching with the fervent wholeheartedness that is necessary to bring about His purposes, and if there are, how He wants you to pray about them.

  > <samp>Seek to know my will through what I have revealed from the beginning. If you love me, keep my word and trust in me. I will manifest myself to you so that you will know my heart.</samp>

2. Begin meditating on Appendix C of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice – Working Definitions Concerning Spiritual Realities. Read slowly, asking the Lord to speak to you through these definitions. Record your thoughts, questions, and journaling about these truths. You will complete the rest of the Appendix in the next lesson.

  > <samp>Lord, you know my heart; and my thoughts are ever present before you. You know the yearning of my soul longing to see a glimpse of your glory; lead me to your truth; your word is truth. Please help me to trust in your word and not lean on my understanding; help me to be discerned in extrapolating truth from another's methodological dispensation. I know your voice, for you are my Shepherd.</samp>

3. Trinity
   1. Discuss the roles of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and you as a believer in prayer.

      <samp>According to the author, the Father initiates the prayers. The Holy Spirit forms the words for us. Prayer is birthed in the prayer. Jesus intercedes with the Father on our behalf.</samp>

   2. Ask the Lord through journaling how He wants to work out this truth in your prayer life.

      > <samp>I have hidden my will from the prudent and wise and revealed them to those with a humble heart. Come to my Son, for he is meek and lowly in heart. Lean on him, learn from him, and you will find rest for your soul. Fear not; my Spirit will lead you because you are mine.</samp>

4. Ask the Lord through journaling if there are issues you are praying for God to move when instead, He is waiting for you to speak to the situation and command His will to be done. Purpose in your spirit that you will seek the Lord’s guidance, even in how to pray.

   > <samp>Wait on me and be of good courage, and I will strengthen your heart. The Lord is near to those who trust in him and lean not on the strength of their belief. My strength will move mountains, not your ability to believe in me. Wait on the Lord, and I will save you.</samp>

5. Destroying imaginations

   1. Write out II Corinthians 10:5.

      > We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.

   2. Journal about this verse, asking the Lord what He wants to say to you personally about it and how He wants to apply it in your life.

      > <samp>There are things too marvelous to understand and beyond the realm of man. Come and sit at my feet; you will learn things too wonderful to contain in your mortality.</samp>

      Virkler:

      > We must cut off instantly any and all pictures shown on our inner screen from satan's projector. We should take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. (Dialogue p. 83)

6. The subjects of submission and authority have been explored several times during this course. Discuss your theology concerning the biblical principle of authority and how it relates to hearing God’s voice. Support your position with Scripture.

   <samp>All authority has been given to Christ. He has commissioned the apostles to make disciples of all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Math 28:18-19). The disciples heard Jesus speak directly to them, charging them with this great commission; in obedience to Christ, the gospel spread worldwide. In Hebrews (1:2), the author reiterated this New Covenant God made with Himself through Jesus. The disciples were eyewitnesses to the Lord's life, death, resurrection, and majesty (1 Pet 5:1; 2 Pet 1:16). The Church Fathers have canonicalized the apostles' writings to preserve the word of the Lord. The Lord has commissioned the Spirit to guide us into all truth concerning the Lord and will bring to remembrance the things the Lord has taught us (John 16:13-15; 14:26). We can hear God's voice through the study and meditation on the scriptures (2Tim 2:15; 1Tim 4:13,15). The study of history and the traditions of the elders also help keep us from wandering into the relativistic truths of this postmodern age and subjective individualism that has become antithetical to the Body of Christ.</samp>

7. Ask the Lord through journaling if there is anyone you have not completely forgiven for everything. Allow Him to show you the situation from His perspective and draw upon His grace to forgive.

   <samp>I know many that I have not forgiven either out of ignorance or forgetfulness. I'm unable to recollect what I cannot remember to forgive those that I might have at some point in life held something against them. At this moment, there is no one, as far as my memory serves me that I have not forgiven. Also, I cannot remember what wrongs any have inflicted on me worthy of forgiveness. But Lord, if I am in error, please help my foolishness, cleanse me of my secret faults, and help me to forgive that I may be forgiven.</samp>
