## Chapter 2: A Cultural Backdrop for Hearing God's Voice

##### Comparison between New Age and Christianity

&nbsp; | Christianity | New Age
--- | :--- | :---
__Intuitive Development__ | Voice of God as intuitive thoughts & impressions. Discerning God's voice to experience life | Intuation as the heart's voice, releases creativity leads to creativity
__Contact with Spirit__ | Holy Spirit and angels sent from God | Any beings in the spirit world
__Method of Quieting Oneself__ | Worship, fixing on Jesus | Mantras
__Use of One's Visionary Abilities__ | God grants divine vision become creativity | Visualize goals recognized as internal ability
__Use of Writing in Spiritual Experiences__ | Record God's voice, not Scripture but tested by it | Record what flows from spirit world being taken over by supernatural force (_automatic writing_)
__The Planet Today__ | Redeemed by working of God's Spirit, angels, and Church | Better through man's efforts
__The Planet Ultimately__ | New Heavens and Earth come through God's direct intervention | Come through man's accomplishments

- New Age is a reaction to God's work
  - Since 1900 over 400 million Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians
  - C. Peter Wagner estimated 1.1 billion _sensitized_ to the Holy Spirit's flow by 2000

- Guardrails

  1. Born-again Christian
  2. Accept the Bible as the inerrant Word of God
  3. Demonstrate love and respect for God by commitment in knowing the Bible
  4. Submission to what God has shown in the bible
  5. Having 2-3 spiritual advisors/counselors

- Spiritual Counselors

  > Obey (Peitho &mdash; allow yourself ot be persuaded by) your leaders, submit to them; for they watch over your soul, as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
  > (Heb 13:17)

  > <br/>
  > &hellip; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety (Prov 11:14 KJV).

  > <br/>
  > Every fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses (2 Cor 13:1)

  - What to look for in a spiritual counselor

    1. A close friend
    2. Solid biblical orientation
    3. Sense the voice of the Spirit of God
    4. Commit himself to the sheep
    5. Receives counsel
    6. Ahead (or alongside) of me in area I am seeking advice

- Journaling & Body of Christ

  - Establish and draw on spiritual advisors
  - Think they made mistakes in hearing then quit
  - Sharing with one of the advisors for confirmation
  - Share only
    1. Certain they came from God
    2. Big decisions

- A Theological Backdrop for Establishing Spiritual Intimacy

  - Against Rationalism
    > Reliance on reason as the basis for establishment of religious ruth;
      a threory that reason is in itself a source of knowledge superior to and
      independent of sense perception

    - Living heart first (_live out of flow_)
    - Enthroned the _heart_ rather than the _brain_
    - Breakout rationalism into the river

      > Trust your heart, more than reason theology of your mind

- World Views

  - Rationalism - space/time/energy/mass boxx
    - Experience through senses: touch, tase, sight, hearing, and smell
    - Travel to the spiritual world, it doesn't exist or unknowable

  - Rationalism/Mysticism Combined
    - Webster
      > A belief in direct spirit encounter with God
    - Recognize you have a _heart/spirit_ also (inner man)

      1. Eyes of the heart, see dreams and vision

      2. Ears of the heart, which hear God's spoken words (other spiritual beings like Satan)

      3. Inner mind, which is able to ponder and mediate deep within (Luke 2:19)

      4. Inner will, where we can make commitments as Paul did when he
         > purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem (Acts 19:21)

      5. Emotion of the heart, where we are able to sense and experience the emotions of Almighty God flowing through us

  - Experiencing the Scripture, Not just analyzing it
    - Stop reading and meditate on these verses NOW!
    - Meditation combines the analysis of the mind with the spontaneity of the heart
    - Your Spirit-anointed mind acts as a check and safeguard, comparing all _rhema_ to _Logos_

    Rational | Spiritual
    --- | ---
    Code of ethics | The power that works within
    Laws | Intimacy (Abba Father)
    Works | Romance (marriage of the Bride)
    Head knowledge | Illumined truth
    Theology | Spirit encounter
    External guidance | Inner witness
    Self effort | Fused strength
    Conscious level only | Dreams, visions, communion

- Hemispheric Brain Functions

  - [An Evaluation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071275) of the Left-Brain vs Right-Brain Hypothesis with Resting State Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    > <samp>It has been conjectured that individuals may be left-brain dominant or right-brain dominant based on personality and cognitive style, but neuroimaging data has <u>not provided clear evidence</u> whether such phenotypic differences in the strength of left-dominant or right-dominant networks exist.</samp>

- Spiritual Intimacy: Desire of God's Heart

  Catch a vision that cummunion is God's deepest desire

  1. Creation (Gen 3:8)
  2. Nation of Israel (Deu 5:22-31; James 2:23)
  3. David (Acts 13:22)
  4. Jesus &mdash; The full Expression of God's Desire (John 17:3)
  5. Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38)
  6. Paul (Phil 3:10)
  7. Us (Heb 12:18-26) "Do not refuse Him who is speaking"
  8. Eternity (Rev 19:7)

  God created us for the supreme purpose of having a love relationship with Him.

<hr class='section' />

1. Complete the journaling exercise found at the end of Chapter 2 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice.

   > My ways are not yours, and neither are my thoughts. Trust in the finished work of my beloved Son on the cross for you. There are things too wonderful for you to understand and beyond your ability to comprehend. Walk with me, and I will show you marvelous things that have not entered your mind. Come, son, into my presence.

2. Contrast the beliefs of the New Age with the beliefs of orthodox Christianity.

   1. The voice of God is intuitive thoughts and impressions coming into one's mind, whereas the New Age's intuition comes from one's heart.
   2. Christians interact with the Holy Spirit and angels as opposed to New Age trying to contact any being in the spirit world.
   3. Quieting oneself by worshiping and fixating on Jesus rather than New Age's repetitious mantras.
   4. Recording spiritual experiences through hearing God's voice rather than the New Age experience of being overtaken by automatic writing.
   5. The planet will be redeemed by God's Spirit, angels, and Church rather than the New Age's focus on man's efforts and accomplishments.

3. Guardrails
   1. State five important safeguards or “guardrails” for hearing God’s voice and all aspects of the spiritual realm.

      1. Born-again Christian
      2. Believe the Bible is God's inerrant word
      3. Demonstrated love and respect for God by knowing his Word
      4. An attitude of submission to what God has shown you from the bible
      5. 2 or 3 spiritual advisors

   2. Evaluate your life in light of these guidelines. Are you ready to explore the world of the Spirit?

      I meet these qualifications and have been exploring the Spiritual landscape.

4. Proverbs 11:14

   1. Write out Proverbs 11:14 NASU.

      Where there is no guidance, the people fall, but in abundance of counselors there is victory.

   2. Discuss why this verse was chosen for you to memorize in this lesson, at the beginning of your course on hearing God’s voice.

      It is important to have godly people in one's life to check if what you're hearing is actually from God.

5. State the six qualities of a good spiritual advisor.

   1. A close friend
   2. Solid biblical orientation
   3. Sense the voice of the Spirit of God
   4. Commit himself to the sheep
   5. Receives counsel from other counselors
   6. Ahead (or alongside) of me in areas I am seeking advice

6. Submission
   1. Memorize the definition of submission given by the author on page 44: “Submission is an openness to the Spirit-led counsel and correction of several others, while keeping a sense of personal responsibility for our own discernment of God’s voice within us.”

      Submission is an openness to the Spirit-led counsel and correction of several others while keeping a sense of personal responsibility for our own discernment of God's voice within us.

   2. Does this definition adjust your thinking concerning submission? Do you disagree with it in any way? If so, support your position. If you disagree with Virkler’s definition, state the meaning of submission that you would be willing to apply both to those to whom you submit and to those who submit to you.

      No, this definition agrees with my sentiments; I don't have any disagreement.

   3. Would embracing this definition change the dynamics of any of your personal relationships? How?

      Embracing this definition does not change any dynamic of my current relationships since it is a subset of my working definition of submission that spans cultural and generational contexts.

7. Other than your spouse, why would it be wise for your advisors to be of the same gender you are?

   So you can speak frankly about things that are too sensitive and might be inappropriate for the opposite sex to hear.

8. What might prevent us from recognizing or embracing the counselors God has given us?

   Lack of trust is a big part of accepting counselors.

   The other factor is cultural bias (in my tradition, one does not choose their counselors, it's the other way around).

9. During your journaling times this week, ask the Lord who He has given to you as your three spiritual advisors. Write them down. Approach them and ask if you can share your journaling with them. Get their agreement to this. Begin sharing (reading or emailing) your journaling with them. (Don’t paraphrase it; read it or email it.) Share your journaling with them at least 3-5 times over the next three weeks. Get confirmation that you are on the right track! Grow in faith! If you skip doing this, this course will not work for you! You must learn to use spiritual advisors!

   Will do! Two have agreed to receive communications from me on regarding my journal entries for this class.

10. Mysticism

    1. State the author’s definition of “mysticism.” (p. 59)

       A belief in direct spirit encounter with God

    2. Look up the word in a dictionary. Which definitions of “mysticism” would be an acceptable part of Christian theology?

      <dl>
        <dt>Oxford</dt>
        <dd>The belief that knowledge of God or of real truth can be found through prayer and meditation rather than through reason and the senses</dd>
        <dt>Webster</dt>
        <dd>The 3rd definition of Webster also has merits "a theory postulating the possibility of direct and intuitive acquisition of ineffable knowledge or power"</dd>
      </dl>

11. Discuss how your worldview up to this time has been either more of “Rationalism” or “Rationalism/Mysticism Combined” (p. 58, 59), and your Christianity more “Rational” or “Spiritual”. Discuss both your belief and your experience.

    My worldview is not fixed nor polarized as an either-or dichotomy but contingent upon the groups and people I interact with. Academically, I'm a rationalist. When I work in a technical environment, I am analytical, detail-oriented, and logical. But when I work with people (particularly those who are not Westerners), I'm relational and flexible. I try to understand the context rather than the information to be conveyed. If I need to define terminology, it would be "Rationalism/Mysticism Combined." I believe that the incomprehensibility of the Divine is hidden from our natural senses but can be communicated through the Holy Spirit (from the Eastern Orthodox tradition) through worship within the Body.

12. Prayerfully read and meditate on I Corinthians 1:18–2:16, asking God to grant you understanding and revelation concerning the verses. Write out your thoughts.

    > Paul believes the power of the cross is inherent in the faithfulness of preaching the cross of Christ without embarking on intellectual debates (2:4-5). However, it does not mean there is no wisdom in the gospel, rather the wisdom is a mystery revealed through the Holy Spirit (2:10-11). God makes known this mystery to believers, not through the world's wisdom, but through His Spirit (2:12-14). The born again Christians have the mind of Christ to perceive an judge spiritual things (2:16).

13. In your own words, discuss the significance of left- and right-brain preferences in spiritual pursuits.

    > According to Dr. Virkler, people are inclined to be either left-brain or right-brain dominant. The left hemispheric dominant person will be more analytical, whereas the counterpart tends to be driven by intuition and vision. Based on this hypothesis, the right-dominant brain is less likely to be subjected to rationalism and, thus, more open to receiving visions and revelations in their pursuit of hearing from God.

14. [Brain Preference Indicator Test](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pd3K3_Rrfev5yFewoF06Q9qdh8AgjPy6Nuulg-0_Pwg/edit?usp=sharing)

    1. Complete the Brain Preference Indicator Test at www.CWGMinistries.org/brain or another one of your choosing. Record your score here.

       `5.320755`

    2. What does your score say about you? Would you say this is an accurate indicator of the way you think and process life?

       According to the number, I use both of my hemispheres equally (leaning slightly to the right). Some of the questions do not reflect my reality. For example, question #1. Depending on what kind of problem I'm solving. If it is a technical problem or something I already have expertise in, I start working on a solution. I might research a new problem I have no expertise. If it is a relational problem, it depends on the person; I seek to understand their cultural background and context. If it is a spiritual problem, I pray, read, and consult with others.
I changed significantly over the years, and my inclinations and proclivities have shifted based on situations and people I encountered.

    3. Based on what you learned in this lesson about brain preference, what does your score indicate that you will need to work on in bringing balance into your spiritual walk?

       I learned that things are not as clearly delineated as I want them to be. In every situation, the need to seek the Lord and understand the context is paramount. I changed significantly over the years, and my inclinations and proclivities have shifted based on what I've learned, my experiences, and the situations and people I encountered in life.
