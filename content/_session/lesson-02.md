## Chapter 2: A Cultural Backdrop for Hearing God's Voice

###### Comparison between New Age and Christianity

&nbsp; | Christianity | New Age
--- | :--- | :---
__Intuitive Development__ | Voice of God as intuitive thoughts & impressions. Discerning God's voice to experience life | Intuation as the heart's voice, releases creativity leads to creativity
__Contact with Spirit__ | Holy Spirit and angels sent from God | Beings in the spirit world
__Method of Quieting Oneself__ | Worship, fixing on Jesus | Mantra
__Use of One's Visionary Abilities__ | God grants divine vision become creativity | Visualize goals recognized as internal ability
__Use of Writing in Spiritual Experiences__ | Record God's voice, not Scripture but tested by it | Record what flows from spirit world being taken over by supernatural force (_automatic writing_)
__The Planet Today__ | Redeemed by working of God's Spirit, angels, and Church | Better through man's efforts
__The Planet Ultimately__ | New Heavens and Earth come through God's direct intervention | Come through man's accomplishments

- NA is a reaction to God's work
  - Since 1900 over 400 million Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians
  - C. Peter Wagner estimated 1.1 billion _sensitized_ to the Holy Spirit's flow by 2000

- Guardrails

  1. Born-again Christian
  2. Accept the Bible as the inerrant Word of God
  3. Demonstrate love and respect for God by commitment in knowing the Bible
  4. Submission to what God has shown in the bible
  5. Having 2-3 spiritual advisors/counselors

- Spiritual Counselors

  > Obey (Peitho &mdash; allow yourself ot be persuaded by) your leaders, submit to them; for they watch over your soul, as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
  > (Heb 13:17)

  > &hellip; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety (Prov 11:14 KJV).

  > Every fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses (2 Cor 13:1)

  - What to look for in a spiritual counselor

    1. A close friend
    2. Solid biblical orientation
    3. Sense the voice of the Spirit of God
    4. Commit himself to the sheep
    5. Receives counsel
    6. Ahead (or alongside) of me in area I am seeking advice


  > Submission is an openness to the Spirit-led counsel and correction of several others, while keeping a sense of personal responsibility for our own discernment of God's voice within us.

- Journaling & Body of Christ

  - Establish and draw on spiritual advisors
  - Think they made mistakes in hearing then quit
  - Sharing with one of the advisors for confirmation
  - Share only
