  > My mercies are new every morning. I continue to be faithful even when you're not and unable to. My promises are eternally sealed in the finished work of my Son on the cross for you. With lovingkindness, I have drawn you to me to show you more extraordinary things you'll find as you search the depths of my love.

  > I want to gather you into my arms and embrace you as a hen gathering her chicks under her wings. Don't be afraid. Come near me. I know your wayward heart and understand your soul's infirmities. Come near, for I am meek and lowly; you will find rest for your turbulent soul.

  > The river of life is my Son Jesus, a wellspring of life within you. It is life, peace, and yearning for the day of His appearance. As this river flows, the world becomes more distant as the cross draws nearer. I will lead you along the river, not your efforts nor your strivings, but by my love and grace, I will lead you.

  > Your soul is wandering in dry and desolate places. Your heart has grown faint, and the heaviness of time presses on the strings of your spirit. Your melodies have become dissonant, and your songs are melancholic. You ran to the brooks and found them desiccated; your lush garden had become barren and destitute of hope altogether. You cried in your spirit, "Where is your God, my people? Why has He hidden His face from you?" Turn your dreary heart to Me, and I will grant you an audience. Draw your soul near Me, and your tears will moisten the barren ground. Cast your soul before the throne of My countenance; I will give you rest. Come, child, find your hope and praise in the Lord.
