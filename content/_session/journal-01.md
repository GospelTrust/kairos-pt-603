  > My son, I love you. I have loved you before the foundation of the world. I will keep you until the end because all that the Father has given me, I will loose none. And precious are my thoughts toward you, and great is the sum of them. Son, when you're awake, I am still here.

  > My ways are not yours, and neither are my thoughts. Trust in the finished work of my beloved Son on the cross for you. There are things too wonderful for you to understand and beyond your ability to comprehend. Walk with me, and I will show you marvelous things that have not entered your mind. Come, son, into my presence.

  > Pour your heart out before me. Don't subdue your thoughts and emotions; empty them like an offering before me. I know what is in your heart and the things that terrify your soul. I have searched you and tried your heart and know your substance. Your frailty is not hidden from me, nor am I troubled by it. Let my arm lead you through the present obscurity, and let my right arm hold you. I am with you even in the darkness where you hide; I know your frame and fragility. You will not find peace. Lean on me. I am your peace.
