  > My son, I love you. I have loved you before the foundation of the world. I will keep you until the end because all that the Father has given me, I will loose none. And precious are my thoughts toward you, and great is the sum of them. Son, when you're awake, I am still here.

  > My ways are not yours, and neither are my thoughts. Trust in the finished work of my beloved Son on the cross for you. There are things too wonderful for you to understand and beyond your ability to comprehend. Walk with me, and I will show you marvelous things that have not entered your mind. Come, son, into my presence.
