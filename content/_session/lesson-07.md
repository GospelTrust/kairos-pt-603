## Summary So Far Concerning Dreams and Visions

1. God does speak to us through dream and vision, as attested by hundreds of Scripture verses.

   <samp>Need to qualify, who the term "us" </samp>

2. Since Jesus is our perfect Example, we are to learn to live the way He did, that is, constantly open to the divine flow of vision.

   <samp>Jesus is not merely an example, He is the only Way to the Father. We must abide in Him, and His word dwell in us to be fruitful (Jhn 15:4-7)</samp>

3. The Bible tells us that God provides a ready and free flow of dreams and visions since we have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the normal Christian life is to experience vision readily (Acts 2:17)

   <samp>The connection between "ready and free flow of dreams and visions" and outpouring of the Holy Spirit to the "normal Christian" is a big leap</samp>

4. Samuel established schools of the prophets to train seers (the original terms for prophets). There is no indication that this process would not be continued.

   <samp>True. There is no indication that it still does. After Samuel, we do not see any more schools in the bible.</samp>

1. Scripture & Journal

   1. Write out John 8:38a.

      > I speak the things which I have seen with my Father.

   2. Journal about what this means to you personally and how the Lord wants to apply it to your life.

      <samp>Jesus was altogether different than me. His consciousness of the Father is so utterly foreign that it is incomprehensible to my nature. The way of God was utterly foreign to me, and only the grace of God can transcend my disillusionment with the divine.</samp>

2. Write out and memorize Key #3 as stated on page 167 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice.

   <samp>Look for vision as you pray</samp>

3. The author lists 18 references to dreams or visions on page 170 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice.

   1. Look up each of these verses. Write a summary of the context of the verse and what it says about dreams and visions.

      - Genesis 15:1 &mdash; Abram saw a vision of the Lord promising protection and reward.

      - Genesis 40:5-7 &mdash; The baker and the cupbearer had dreams that required Joseph to interpret.

      - Exodus 3:1-6 &mdash; An angel appeared to Moses, drawing him to God, and he was afraid to look upon God.

      - Numbers 12:6 &mdash; God says he will show himself in a vision and speak to a prophet in a dream.

      - Deuteronomy 13:1-5 &mdash; God warns that if a prophet dreams of turning people away from walking with God, that prophet should be put to death.

      - Joshua 5:13-15 &mdash; Joshua saw an angel that was the captain of the Lord's host and told him to take off his shoes.

      - 1 Samuel 28:6 &mdash; Saul sought the Lord but found him not in dreams nor in prophets.

      - 1 Kings 3:5-6 &mdash; The Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and asked Solomon to make a request.

      - Ezekiel 12:22-27 &mdash; The Lord told Ezekiel that prophesy and vision would be restored soon to the people.

      - Daniel 8:15-18 &mdash; Daniel saw a vision and sought it until Gabriel came and touched him.

      - Matthew 2:12-13 &mdash; God warned Joseph in a dream about Herod's plan and told him to flee to Egypt.

      - Acts 9:10-12 &mdash; Ananias had a dream, and the Lord told him to go to Straight street to pray for Saul to receive sight again.

      - Acts 11:5-6 &mdash; Peter saw in a vision all kinds of animals were displayed before him.

      - Romans 11:8,10 &mdash; God has shut their eyes that they might not see.

      - Ephesians 1:18 &mdash; The eyes of understanding enlightened will know God's calling and the glory.

      - Revelation 1:10,14 &mdash; John saw a vision of Jesus while he was in the Spirit.

      - Revelation 4:2-3 &mdash; When John was in the spirit, he saw a throne with a figure sitting on the throne.

      - Revelation 15:5 &mdash; John saw the tabernacle of Testimony open.

   2. Ask the Lord through journaling if there is anything He wants to say to you specifically through each verse. (He may not have anything to say about some of them, but at least ask and give Him the opportunity to speak to you personally about His Word.)

      Ephesians 1:17-19 &mdash; <samp>through the Lord Jesus, the Father has given the church wisdom and revelation of who He is. The Holy Spirit reveals this truth through the text and grants the eyes of my heart the grace to believe and understand the redemptive power of Christ's resurrection and love for the lost.</samp>

   3. Once you have prayerfully looked at all of the verses, write a summary of what you believe about the place of dream and vision in our communication with the Lord based on these and any other Scriptures you want to include. Write as Luke did, who examined all the facts carefully and then wrote in dependence upon the Holy Spirit to breathe truth through him.

      <samp>God uses dreams and vision to communicate with saints to communicate with His people His will concerning Jesus Christ as it is written in the scriptures.</samp>

4. Visions

   1. List the five kinds of visions given by the author.

      1. Spontaneous Vision on the Screen Within Your Mind
      2. Spontaneous Vision While in Prayer
      3. Seeing a Vision Outside of Yourself
      4. Vision While in a Trance
      5. The Visionary Encounter of Dreams

   2. Have you ever experienced any of these kinds of visions? Describe one example from each type you have experienced, giving the context and results as well as the visionary encounter.

      <samp>I once had a vision from a bird's eye view of a lush forest. I told my sister that this was the confirmation that because she waited on the Lord, she was taken up on the wings of an eagle (Isaiah 40:31). I was affirming her desire to marry the man in question. I could not confirm nor deny whether what I saw was a vision from the Lord or a scene in some movies I've watched. But life went on, and I continued to pray for their marriage and family.</samp>

5. Worshiping an Image

   1. In your own words, discuss the contrast the author makes between setting a scene in your mind and worshipping an image.

      <samp>The author argues that the scene in our minds is not carved with wood or stone; it is not considered an object of worship. The image that you create is the image of the invisible God. And these images are not "human-initiated representations of the likeness of God" but divinely shown.</samp>

   2. Do you agree that the author’s position is legitimate and an accurate presentation of truth? Why or why not?

      <samp>I'm not in agreement with the above position because I cannot be certain the images displayed in the screen of my mind were divinely inspired or came from my imagination; I might be in danger of idolizing my pursuit to envision God in an image.</samp>

6. Carefully read the Summary So Far Concerning Dreams and Visions beginning on page 183 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice and A Biblical Foundation beginning on page 68 of Dialogue with God. Which of the points do you find most compelling? Which would you use to defend your position on vision or to reassure an honest seeker of the truth as you know it?

   <samp>The point I find most compelling is the appeal to fix our eyes on Jesus. I don't seek reassurance in my sincerity because in this flesh "dwell no good thing" (Rom 7:18). I cannot base my life on the authenticity of my faith; I trust in what Jesus has said in the bible and cry out to the Lord for the grace to keep me. I do not seek to grasp or even attempt to ascertain a vision that would mesmerize the heart, leading me away from Jesus.</samp>

7. Complete the Personal Application exercise at the end of Chapter 7 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice.

   Lord, how important is it to use the eyes of my heart?
   How have I been using them?
   How would You have me use them?

   <samp>The gods of this world have blinded your eyes, and because of my grace, they have been healed to see the glorious gospel of Christ, the image of God. Let your light continue to shine in this darkness through your faith in me. Do not forget the former days when your heart was enlightened, and you endured the fight of afflictions. Continue to fight the good fight, and I will enlighten your eyes to understand the Scriptures and come to know the exceeding greatness of my deliverance and the power of my resurrection. Trust not in your heart but set your heart on me; let not your heart be troubled, but trust in my word and the Spirit will illuminate the understanding.</samp>

## Questionable

- 4KHGV Learn, p.19

  > The Church needs first hand revelation, not passed down theology.

  <samp>Should we then throw out the Christian theological traditions?</samp>

- 4KHGV Learn, p.21

  > God has commanded us to imagine His Word ("meditate" - Josh 1:8; 1 Chron 29:18)

  - Joshua 1:8 <samp>הָגָה means to _meditate, muse_.</samp>
  - 1 Chron 29:18 <samp>מַחֲשָׁבָה means _thoughts of the mind_</samp>
  - <samp>"Imagine" is nowhere to be found in these references</samp>

- 4KHGV, p.205

  > I will imagine it and pray over it and meditate upon it! I will not let my Bible times descend into Western rationalism!

  <samp>The above statements was carefully crafted into repeatable mantras of Western ideology. Self-referential paradoxes are hard to escape.</samp>
