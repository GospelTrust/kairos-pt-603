1. Drawing Near

   > <samp>I will not remember your sins and iniquities, the blood of Jesus has paved the way for you to draw near to me. Don't draw near because you can feel it in your heart but because of the promise I made through my Son. Don't be afraid; you can come because your High Priest's blood has cleansed your guilty conscience.</samp>

2. Meditate on Hebrews 8:5 and journal about it, asking God what He wants to speak to you concerning the verse and its application to your life.

   > <samp>I am your High Priest forever; you do not need to recreate the old Tabernacle, for you are the temple where the Holy Spirit takes up residence. Hold not to the form of the old but live freely in the new covenant I made through my Son. He is merciful to your unrighteousness, and your sins and iniquities are no more remembered.</samp>

3. In your own words, discuss the six pieces of furniture in the tabernacle of Moses and their place in your approach to God.

   - <samp>The Brazen Altar symbolizes the death of Jesus to shed the blood required to enter the holy place</samp>
   - <samp>The Brazen Laver symbolizes the washing of the word sanctifying, reflecting Jesus as we look intently on His teachings</samp>
   - <samp>The Table of Shewbread represents our will to submit to God's molding and shaping</samp>
   - <samp>The Golden Lampstand represents the enlightened mind by the Holy Spirit</samp>
   - <samp>The Altar of Incense is our emotions offered to God in worship as a sacrifice</samp>
   - <samp>The Ark is where the Holy Spirit reveals the things of God to our hearts</samp>

4. Complete the Personal Application on page 262 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice. See also page 133 of Dialogue with God for more detailed ideas for your journaling.

   > <samp>Draw near the mercy seat, and I will commune with you. You will find mercy and grace in my presence. The blood of my Son paved the way for you to come into my presence. His blood was shed for your cleansing. His body was broken to give you life as you partake in His life-giving flesh. Listen to His voice as you learn to recognize the Shepherd of your soul. My Spirit will light the way through the darkness as you come to me with the gladness of your soul and rejoice in thanksgiving and praises.</samp>

5. Promised Land

   1. What does the author mean by “your promised land”?

      <samp>What the author means by "your promised land" is God has promised the blessing, but you have to fulfill the conditions to receive the blessing.</samp>

   2. Discuss some of the things that may keep you from entering your promised land.

      <samp>Not honoring God like Moses struck the rock in anger. Not trusting God during trials and grumbling and complaining instead of confessing faith.</samp>

6. In Lesson 8 you were asked to become more aware of the pictures you see in your mind and heart, testing them by their spirit, their ideas, and their fruit. (See exercise #3 in Lesson 8.) Discuss your experience and what you have learned. (Note: This same question will be repeated in multiple sessions.)

   <samp>As I come to the Lord in worship, the sweetness of God's presence melts all the anxieties and fears from my heart, elevating my soul to the realm of supernatural peace. The tenderness of the Holy Spirit was pleasant to my soul as I lingered in that transient serenity.</samp>

7. Complete the Personal Application on page 280 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice. (Note, this application is to be completed over a six-day period.)
