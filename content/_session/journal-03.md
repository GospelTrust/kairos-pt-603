> I will teach you to number your days and apply wisdom to your understanding of Me. Your days are like shadows that appear momentarily, yet I consider your abbreviated existence and look upon your transience nature with mercy. Turn to Me, for I'm gracious unto you; in the dark recesses of your mind, I will shine a light upon the countenance of my Son. The glory of His radiance will fill every obscured corner of your heart with the luminous grace of His everlasting presence.
