## Academic Integrity / Plagiarism

#### Doing Your Own Work.

Students are required to do their own work. Group study and review sessions are fine and are encouraged. But when completing an assignment or writing a paper, students must do their own work. Similarly, when taking a quiz or an exam, whether in the classroom or online, students are to do their own work.

#### "Closed Book" Quizzes and Exams.
If a quiz or exam is "closed book," students are to take it without the aid of their Bible, any books, reference works, or notes. [Professors will designate whether an exam is closed book, or whether students may use their Bibles or notes, etc.] Using notes or other materials when taking a quiz or exam that is "closed book" constitutes cheating.

#### Proper Attribution / Plagiarism.
For term papers & research papers, it is expected that students will read and use multiple sources. When referring to information that is commonly known, footnotes are not needed. However, if students use detailed information drawn from a specific source, they must give credit to that author; in specific, they must identify the book, author, and page # of the source. If failure to do so is an honest oversight, as a minimum, it will reduce the grade of a paper.  But if a student passes off research done by another person as his or her own work, that is plagiarism, which is a serious violation of academic integrity.

#### Consequences for Violations of Academic Integrity:
In the case of a violation any of the above, at the discretion of the professor and the Academic Dean of Kairos University, based on the seriousness of the violation, any of the following consequences may be imposed:

- The student may be required to re-accomplish the work or exam in question, or to complete a designated alternate assignment; such work will receive a maximum grade of "C".
- The student will not be given an opportunity to re-accomplish the work and will receive an "F" for the work in question. This may result in the student receiving a grade of "F" for the course.

For repeated violations of academic integrity in more than one course, a student may be dismissed
from the university.

## Course Requirements & Grading Factors

#### Attendance and Participation Requirements:

Students are required to attend all live Zoom sessions unless they are ill or there are extenuating circumstances.

#### Attendance Component of the Grade / Penalties for Missed Classes:

Discussion and participation during class is a factor that counts toward the course grade.

#### Instructions for Required Assignments / Grading Criteria:

- Answering all the Lessons exercise questions on the Kairos portal.
- Submit on the Kairos Portal (Week 2) student’s 2-3 spiritual advisors/counselors.
- Completely read [Dialogue with God] by Mark Virkler as assigned.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: You will notice that all of the instructional materials for this course were written by the same authors and that they all teach essentially the same truths. So be prepared: there will be repetition in your lessons. The chapter from the [4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice] book will talk about the same thing as the chapter in Dialogue with God which will be the same teaching as the video recordings.

- You will be required to submit one two-way journal assignment per week starting on Week 2.

- Use the book [Talking with Jesus] as part of your daily devotions for the entire time you are taking this course.

- You are required to earn at least 85% on the [Midterm] (due week 3) and the Final Test (due week 6). The Course Objectives are the key to success on the tests.

- Submit a [Final Reflection paper][Paper 1] (due week 6) discussing how your life has been affected as a result of your encounter with God through this course.
  - What changes has He brought in your understanding, attitudes, and behavior?
  - Who are the people He has placed as counselors in your life?
  - What are the methods which are most effective in bringing you to stillness?
  - How have you used vision and what have the results been?
  - Most importantly, how has your relationship with the Lord been affected as a result of this study?

  This paper is to be a minimum of five type written pages and is due at the end of the course.

- [Am I Being Deceived?] – Mark and Patti Virkler

  Read the entire book and submit a [paper][Paper 2] of 4 pages typed (no larger than 12-point font) and double-spaced (or 2 pages single-spaced) in response to this book. Draw together your observations, reactions, and experiments into a cohesive report. This paper is to be submitted to your instructor with the Final Test (Due Week 6).

  Discuss how your mind has been opened and your thoughts expanded through your meditation upon this book. What new truths have you discovered?

  Did you change theologically and/or experientially as a result of this book? Describe any such changes.

- Foundational to _lamad_ (see below) learning is the meditation upon and memorization of Scripture.

  You will be required to memorize Bible verses and passages in every one of your lamad courses. This is not just busy work! Each verse has been carefully chosen to support and complement the principles of the course and the lesson it is a part of. Memorizing Scripture builds a foundation of truth in your heart that the Spirit will be able to draw from to speak to you and lead you and comfort you and correct you throughout the rest of your life.

  The Hebrew language uses one root (lamad) for the two words "to teach" and "to learn." In the Hebrew culture, the teacher has not taught unless the student has learned. All learning and teaching are ultimately to be found in the fear of the Lord. The goal of teaching is not the impartation of facts but the changing of lives. For the Hebrew, knowledge (yada) involves personal encounters and responses to God's revelation. In the lamad method of learning, we are returning to the Hebraic concept of education, including this personal encounter and revelation.

  The classroom becomes a place of impassioned discussion and the sharing of real life experiences. It is a place where we meet God and share in the life experiences of others. It is a place where we practice truth. The classroom is not separated from life but is actually part of our lives.

#### Grades will be Based on the Following:

As indicated below, “C” or 2.0 level work is considered average. Leaders are not average people. You are therefore expected (required) to put forth the effort necessary to demonstrate at least “B” (3.0) level work or higher on all assignments which you submit. Any which do not will be returned to you with input from your instructor on how you can raise your grade to the expected level. A course grade will not be given until your assignments demonstrate that you have understood the material presented in the course and allowed your life to be transformed by the Spirit and the Word studied the requirements for attaining a “B”.

Your individual assignments (notebooks, tests, papers) will be graded according to the following standards. These grades will be averaged together to determine your course grade. Remember, we are training leaders and leaders are above-average people. Your work will reflect that.

Grade | Meaning
--- | ---
D | Indicates barely passing work that is inferior to the average both in quantity and quality. Manifests a lack of initiative or sense of responsibility or both.
C | Average work; either steady work of an acceptable quality or work of a high quality which is uneven, irregular, or fragmentary. May be mechanically or outwardly correct but shows little reflection upon or personal assimilation of the material.
B | Intelligently has fulfilled the requirements of this course. Understands the subject matter presented and has applied it to his life in a limited manner but has not really made the truths his own.
A | Grasped the material with thoroughness, industry, and correctness of detail. Made the material his own by thinking about it and integrating it, using originality, natural ability, and insight.

## Projected Course Schedule & Assignments

The format of this course is highly accelerated. We will be covering two lessons per week. Each lesson when completed according to the guidelines and instructions should be equivalent to 5-6 hours of homework per lesson; meaning one should be spending anywhere from 10-12 hours per week during the duration of this course. All required reading and videos must be completed before the start of the class. This is to ensure all students are ready to discuss and participate during class. At the start of each class, students should be ready to answer the following statements:

1. Here is what God has revealed through the reading, videos, and exercises…
2. Here is what I have a question on...
