   > Open the door to me, my love, my beloved. Take my hand and come with me into the valley of delight. Close your eyes and let my Spirit show you the redemption story of old. Join the heavenly chorus to sing the praises of your Redeemer.


- Hebrews 10:22

   > I will not remember your sins and iniquities, the blood of Jesus has paved the way for you to draw near to me. Don't draw near because you can feel it in your heart but because of the promise I made through my Son. Don't be afraid; you can come because your High Priest's blood has cleansed your guilty conscience.

- Hebrews 8:5

   > I am your High Priest forever; you do not need to recreate the old Tabernacle, for you are the temple where the Holy Spirit takes up residence. Hold not to the form of the old but live freely in the new covenant I made through my Son. He is merciful to your unrighteousness, and your sins and iniquities are no more remembered.
