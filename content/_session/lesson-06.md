## Removing Inner Noise

Problem | Solution
--- | ---
Thoughts of things to do | Write them down to not forget
Thoughts of sin-consciousness | Confess, clothe with robe of righteousness
Mind flirting about | Focus on vision of Jesus
Need to get in touch with your heart | Singing, listening to the spontaneous song bubbling up from your heart
Need for more time to commune when your mind is poised and still | Times of automatic activities are ideal for hearing from God

1. Virkler's abridged Psalm 46:10
   1. Write out the expanded version of Psalm 46:10.

      > Be sill, _let go, cease striving, relax,_ and know that I am God.

   2. Discuss what it means and journal about how the Lord wants to apply it to your life.

      <samp>It does not mean "don't think anything," but as in the writings of Teresa of Avila and St John of the Cross, the focus is on the consciousness of God coming to us by grace and not by our efforts. The inward finding of God is not an act of intellectual vision but a prayer of love. "Be still" is Jesus' call to cease from the turmoil of the soul and the weariness of the mind and find rest in coming to the Lord. The heart enters the interior castle of the soul to find God with all of its desires. "And know that I am God" involves withdrawing the faculties that produce thoughts into a suspended state and letting Him draw me into a perfect union with Christ.</samp>

2. Write out and memorize Key #2 as stated on page 149 of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice.

   <samp>Quiet yourself so you can hear God's voice.</samp>

3. Removing the inner noise

   1. When is your optimal time of day? Are you a morning person or don’t you really wake up until lunch is served? If you wanted to give the Lord your best, most focused, and awake time, when would that be?

      <samp>I have two optimized times of the day when I am most focused and have the most energy. From 7:30 to 9 am, and the second is from 5:30 to 9 pm.</samp>

   2. Where can you go to get away from the distractions of your life? Do you need to create a quiet place? Do you need to ask for the help and or respect of your family in establishing a place?

      <samp>Daily, at my desk, I'm least distracted and most focused. On the weekends, I fast and separate myself from others (except through worship and prayers). I also retreat to the mountains to fast and pray for extended periods.</samp>

   3. Ask the Lord through journaling where and when He wants to meet with you. Then purpose in your spirit to keep this appointment with the Lover of your soul at least three days each week at least until you complete this course (i.e. for at least six weeks).

      <samp>I try to meet with Lord constantly throughout my day.</samp>

4. Discuss several ways by which you can quiet your thoughts and your mind.
   - <samp>Make a todo list of things, so you don't have to worry about them</samp>
   - <samp>Confess your sins, so you are not anxious/conscious and receive forgiveness from God</samp>
   - <samp>Focus on the finished work of Christ on the cross</samp>
   - <samp>Be sensitive to the Holy Spirit bringing into your minds the things that Christ has taught you</samp>
   - <samp>Be aware and conscious of the presence and thoughts of the Lord</samp>

5. Complete the Personal Application exercise at the end of Chapter 6 of 4 Keys to Hearing God's Voice.

   1. Lord, what means have I used to effectively still myself?

      <samp>Fasting deprives the body of its basic desires bringing into captivity the will of the flesh and submitting to the Holy Spirit's authority. Praise has been the constant companion as the means to enter into His courts and gaze at my Lord. Reciting the scriptures and through the voices of the saints shapes my words and thoughts toward the exaltation of Jesus.</samp>

   2. What methods would You like me to cultivate?

      <samp>Methods are means, but they are not the goal. The Lord wants me to know that He will meet me as I come. He wants my heart to desire Him and expect whatever means of grace He endows; I will experience the greatest revelation of Jesus through the faith of the Son of God, who loves me and gave Himself entirely for me.</samp>

6. Experiment with the various tools for coming to the inner stillness presented in the texts. Describe what you do, and the results that you have. Don’t just give up after one attempt if a particular tool doesn’t seem to help you become centered. Try it at least a half-dozen times before abandoning something that you might find very beneficial with practice.

   <samp>I'm learning to suspend the faculties of the mind and human efforts to present myself before my Creator. Let go of strivings and agendas in approaching God and finding rest in His love. I will continue to practice being in the presence of God and yielding to the Holy Spirit's leading me outside of my experiences into an utterly incomprehensible union with Christ.</samp>
