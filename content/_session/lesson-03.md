- Israel wanted to be governed by laws (Deut 5:22-31)
- God offered _His voice_ (restoring fellowship) but Israelites turned down relationship and preferred the law.
- God continues to speak but only Moses wanted it
  - Moses got relationship
  - Israelites got the law
- David enters the scene, "I have found David... a man after Mine own heart" (Acts 13:22).

  - He saw His Father work (John 5:19-20, 30; 8:26, 28, 38)

#### Come WHolly Unto Me

5 Aspects of wholeheartedness that God requires in our approach to Him:

1. Make Me your **greatest treasure** so I can give Myself to you (Mark 12:30)
2. **Search** for Me with your whole heart so I can reveal Myself to you (Jer 29:13)
3. **Trust** Me with your whole heart so I can guide your steps (Prov 3:5)
4. **Praise** Me with your whole heart so I can gift you with My presence (Ps 9:1)
5. **Return** to Me with your whole heart so I can be compassionate and bless you (Joel 2:12)

- God yearns to be your Friend
- Wants you to recognize His voice
- Spend intimate time with Him
- Offer your physical senses, faculty of your soul
- Move our of your box and into His flow
- Out of your mind and into your heart
- Out of rationalism into true spiritual Christianity

#### A Two-way Love Letter

- Start with:
  > Jesus this is why I love You so much...

- Other's share how they sense the Holy Spirit

  1. God's voice comes often as a spontaneous thought
  2. The eyes of our hearts are used as God grants vision
  3. The writing of these things is often important

- From _Hear His Voice_ by Douglas Wead

  <ul class='poem'>
    <li>An impression came to me.</li>
    <li>In my mind, I saw a girl sitting at the table...</li>
    <li>I jotted down the thoughts.</li>
  </ul>

- How does spontaneous revelation actually come? From _Spiritual Gifts and You_ by Larry Tomczak
  1. Pictures

     God spoke to the prophets through pictures and visions

  2. Scripture

     God speaks through specific Bible verses that come to mind. He may impress a part of a verse, even a reference, upon your mind

  3. A word

     God may bring to your mind a specific word or a piece of advice that did not come as the result of a detailed thought process

#### Personal Application

- Choose a Gospel story that's comfortable to you
- Picture the story
- Allow yourself to be present with Jesus
- Fix your gaze on Him
- Ask Him the question that is on your heart
- Don't test it as you receive it
- Test it &mdash; share it with your spiritual advisors &mdash; after the flow is finished
