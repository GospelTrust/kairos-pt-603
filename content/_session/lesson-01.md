## Chapter 1: How I Discovered the Four Keys

- Not **just** doctrine

  - John 5:39-40: You search the Scriptures...and unwilling to come to Me.
    - <samp>Where do we "hear" these words that Jesus "spoke" today?</samp>
  - "Intellectual exercise does not profit our spirit at all"
  - Ex 15:26: He speaks directory to us.
    - "So listening to God's voice came **before** the Law was given"
  - Faith is more important than the Law
    - <samp>Does the "Law" here means the bible?</samp>
    - "Hear him speak is more important than follwing the law, the Torah, the Scriptures"

- Charles Finney: Three Classes of Christians
  - Saved class: Love the Scriptures
  - Laying too much stress in teaching and believing the facts and doctrines of the Gospel
  - Stopping short of trusting the personal Christ

- "Hearing god's voice cannot be anything more difficult than an 8-year-old can do!"

- 4 Keys to hearing God's voice:
  - Stillness: Quiet yourself so you can hear God's voice
  - Vision: Look for vision as you pray.
  - Spontaneity: Recognize God's voice as spontaneous thoughts that light upon your mind.
  - Journaling: Write down that flow of thoughts and pictures.

- "Worked in every culture and every circumstance and every age group"

> I will <u>stand on my guard post</u> and station myself on the rampart; and I will <u>keep watch to see</u> what <u>He will speak to me</u>, and how I may reply when I am reproved. Then the LORD answered me and said, "<u>Record the vision</u> and inscribe it on tablets, that the one who reads it may run. For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it hastens toward the goal and it will not fail though it tarries, wait for it; for it will certainly come, it will not delay."

- 4 Keys: Habakkuk 2:1-3
  1. I will stand on my guard post (be still)
  2. I will keep watch to see (fix your eyes on Jesus)
  3. He will speak to me (tune to spontaneity)
  4. Then the Lord answered me and said, "Record the vision." (Write the flow of thoughts and pictures that light upon your heart and mind)

- Reflections on Learning to Hear God's Voice
  - Christ often speaks back to us using Scripture (_rhema_ and _Logos_)
  - Look to experiences as experiments, grow in confidence and saw positive results
  - React to God's ideas through analytical thoughts and questions. Distinction between Christ's spontaneous thoughts and my analytical thoughts
  - His voice lines up with inner thoughts (you already have) don't doubt that it is His voice
  - God doesn't want anything more than you have given
  - When prayers are not answered, ask Him why
