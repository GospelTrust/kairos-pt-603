1. Quote each of the following Scriptures, then discuss the significance of the verse(s) in a course on learning to hear God’s voice. (5 points each – partial credit may be given)

   1. Habakkuk 2;1, 2: I will stand…

      > I will stand on my guard post and station myself on the rampart; I will keep watch to see what he will speak to me; And I will know how to reply when I am reproved. Then the LORD answered me and said, "Record the vision and inscribe it on tablets, that the one who reads may run."

      <samp>This verse gives the foundation for the four keys to hearing God's voice. These are: "I will stand" (being still); "Keep watch to see" (fixing your eyes on Jesus); "He will speak to me" (tune to spontaneity); "Record the vision" (journaling).</samp>

   2. Proverbs 11:14 NASU: Where there is…

      > Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in the abundance of counselors there is victory.

      <samp>This verse shows the importance of having people I trust to speak into my life, help me synthesize my thoughts and understanding of the spiritual, and keep me accountable to the Body of Christ.</samp>

   3. John 17:3: And this is…

      > This is eternal life, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent.

      <samp>Jesus' prayer for us to know God intimately and enter a spiritual fellowship with God. God desires intimacy with us.</samp>

   4. Isaiah 55:10, 11: For as the…

      > For as the rain which comes down from heaven, and not returns there without watering the earth, and making it bear and sprout, furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater. So shall my words be which goes forth from my mouth; It shall not return to me empty; without accomplishing what I desire, and without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.

      <samp>God's voice can accomplish and perform what he has purposed it. We receive the word of God both as the Logos and rhema. Recognizing God's voice through both means allows us to accomplish what God has decreed.</samp>

   5. John 7:37b-39a: If any man…

      > "If any man is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the scripture said, 'From his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.'" But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive.

      <samp>The Spirit flows naturally from within when we put our trust in Jesus and pray in the Spirit and allowing him to inspire, guide, and sustain our prayers.</samp>

   6. Psalm 46:10 expanded: Be still…

      > Be still, let go, cease striving, relax, and know that I am God.

      <samp>Quiet the mind, cease trying to have my needs fulfilled, and stay focused on the Lord and His being.</samp>
