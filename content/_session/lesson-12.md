1. Continue meditating on Appendix C of 4 Keys to Hearing God’s Voice – Working Definitions Concerning Spiritual Realities. Read slowly, asking the Lord to speak to you through these definitions. Record your thoughts, questions, and journaling about these truths.

   > <samp>Godly lives have consequences. You cannot have both the world and me. Amid the spurns and scorns of the world, you will find peace and rest in me. I sent you as a lamb for the slaughter but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. Trust in me; as you come under my yoke, you will find rest for your weary soul.</samp>

2. Complete the application at the end of Chapter 10 of Dialogue with God. Enter into the guided imagery exercise with your whole heart, using your imagination to picture the scene. Then ask the Holy Spirit to take over and fill the eyes of your heart with His vision, taking it wherever He will. Record what you see and hear.

   <samp>I cannot visualize any imagery except for the thick emptiness of space. What I heard were words that were familiar to me.</samp>

   > <samp>Where will you go from my Spirit? Where will you flee from my presence? If you ascend to heaven, I'm there. If you make your bed in hell, I'm also there. If you take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost place of the sea, even there shall my hand lead you, and my right-hand hold you. If you say the darkness has covered you, even the night shall be as light before you.</samp>


   > <samp>Take the plunge into the river of my delight. In that sea of forgetfulness are my mercy and love. Take no thoughts of tomorrow; I'm here and will be here when you awake.</samp>
